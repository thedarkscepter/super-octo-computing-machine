Covid-19 had a violent impact on students, teachers and parents all around the globe, as homes were turned into an online classroom overnight, students were forced into not only finding the right physical environment, but also finding the right mental state to be able to attend school in their homes. I had to adapt. As exams were cancelled assignment submission became the number one priority and in order to be able to meet all the deadlines that were set, time management became crucial. As I learnt how to manage time I not only became more flexible as a student, but also as an individual. During online school there was never a scarcity of distractions, but I had to overcome the temptations for my own betterment. This in addition to maintaining a time table has disciplined me. I never really was an empathetic individual, however watching the people around me suffer for things beyond their control has opened my eyes. The suffering all around me has sensitized me, it has taught me to be empathetic to people. It has also given me a more positive outlook on life, as I saw people recover from situations through sheer willpower, where I thought all hope was lost. As all of the classes I attended became online, physical activity also became vital, else it would be my health that suffered. I did not have time to exercise, I had to make time to keep myself healthy, this process moved me out of my comfort zone. Ironically it made me comfortable not being in my comfort zone.
