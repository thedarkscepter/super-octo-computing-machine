9th standard is a significant year in a student’s life. I knew that walking into it, however this made it all the more important for me to remain healthy. I could not afford to miss out on my academics, not this year. As Covid-19 ran rampant in the streets I had to take precautions. Not only the necessary ones, but also extra precautions so as to reduce my risk to exposure as much as possible. 2020 has been a tough year and I intend on making good on the saying “what doesn’t kill you makes stronger”. I intend on taking all of the problems I face as challenges meant to better myself as both a student and a human being. This year taught me how important even the smallest of things can be and this has further influenced me to dedicate myself to my studies in order to become the person I always dreamt of being. A responsible, smart and empathetic individual. I will use all of the qualities I have instilled in myself throughout this year to become a model student. During this pandemic I saw Charles Darwin’s argument come to life. “Those communities which included the greatest number of the most sympathetic members would flourish best” he quoted in his book “On the Origin of Species”. This pandemic has taught me that human beings as a species united will overcome any and all challenges they face come what may.
